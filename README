ahhhk - A Compiler for the AHHH programming language


ahhhk is an implementation of Kyle Morgenstein's (KyleM73) esoteric
programming language as a static compiler.

Currently, ahhhk can target x86-64 based systems, however,
32-bit x86, aarch64 support and possibly RISC-V is planned for
future versions.

The operating systems supported by ahhhk at present are Windows and Linux,
however, linking manually should enable compiling AHHH for other
operating systems, especially Mac OS X and other unices (e.g. FreeBSD).

Dependencies
------------

 - a working C compiler implementing a few of gcc's extensions (most
   modern compilers work adequately without modification of ahhhk)
 - GNU make or compatible
 - xxd (present on all unices)
 - nasm (recommended)
 - ld (recommended)

Building
--------

Simple: just run make

Using AHHH
----------

The best explanation of how to write AHHH programmes is given by
``README.md'' in Kyle Morgenstein's interpreter: <github.com/KyleM73/AHHH>.
